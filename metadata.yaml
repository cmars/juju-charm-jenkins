  project or jobs run by cron. Among those things, current Jenkins focuses
  on the following two jobs: - Building/testing software projects
  continuously, just like CruiseControl or  DamageControl. In a
  nutshell, Jenkins provides an easy-to-use so-called  continuous
  integration system, making it easier for developers to integrate
  changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a
  fresh  build. The automated, continuous build increases the
  productivity. - Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs, such as
  cron jobs and procmail  jobs, even those that are run on a remote
  machine. For example, with cron,  all you receive is regular e-mails
  that capture the output, and it is up to  you to look at them
  diligently and notice when it broke. Jenkins keeps those  outputs and
  makes it easy for you to notice when something is wrong.
